This folder contains the generic build system for the entire KOW framework project.


All reused code for building code (*sic*) is inside this repository - which should be distribuited
with every release we make. :)

The KOW Framework is composed by:


APQ (and submodules) :: Database Bindings for several vendors with a unified API.

KOW_Lib	:: generic stuff we use all the time (except on APQ) we had no other place to put;.
KOW_Config :: manages configuration files for your application in an easy way
KOW_Ent :: Tagged Types => Database mapping in Ada
KOW_View :: the Web Framework in the KOW Framework, based on AWS.
